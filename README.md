# Bidirectional LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks) 
* Capture context from both directions simultaneously.
* Enhance information flow by considering past and future context.
* Better handle sequential data with bidirectional dependencies.
* Robust feature extraction from input sequences.
* Mitigate vanishing gradient problem, aiding training of deep architectures.
